This is a short help for AndroidChessClock.<br>
<br>
With AndroidChessClock you have a chess clock to play a timed 
chess match.<br>
<br>
Put your device beside your chess board so that the side for white 
is matching the white button and thus for black accordingly. After 
a player has done a move he can tap the button of his color (that 
should be nearest to him, because we put the device appropriate) to 
start the clock of his opponent.<br>
Usually the player has to use the same hand for the tap as he used to 
do his move.<br>
<br>
There are some options you can use to customize the clock.<br>
<br>
Set the times for each side individually (in minutes).<br>
Set the time delay scheme to use (None, Fischer, Bronstein).<br>
None means, the time normally runs down when a player is 
in turn.<br>
Fischer means, when the player gets in turn, he automatically gets a 
time bonus added to his time.<br>
Bronstein means, when a player gets in turn, the time starts running down 
after a given delay.
