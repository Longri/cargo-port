This project implements a level based puzzle game similar to cargobot (iphone) or lightbot (android). You have to control a portal crane moving boxes from a given position into a target position. You have to compose simple commands (move up/down/left/right, grab/release box, run subroutine 1/2) in command sets, where you have one main routine with 16 slots and two subroutines with also 16 slots each.
